Generalized Shapley Additive Explanations (G-SHAP) is a technique in explainable AI for answering broad questions in machine learning.

## Abstract

Many important questions about a model cannot be answered just explaining how much each feature contributes its output. To answer a broader set of questions, we generalize a popular, mathematically well-grounded explanation technique, Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP). Our new method - Generalized Shapley Additive Explanations (G-SHAP) - produces many additional types of explanations including: 1) *General classification explanations*; Why is this sample more likely to belong to one class rather than another? 2) *Intergroup differences*; Why do our modelâ€™s predictions differ between groups of observations? 3) *Model failure*; Why does our model perform poorly on a given sample? We formally define these types of explanations and illustrate their practical use on real data.
