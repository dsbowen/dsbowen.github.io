Hemlock provides tools and models for creating and deploying surveys. It aspires to be the most powerful and flexible method of survey creation.

## License

Hemlock was created first and foremost as a free, open-source tool for academic and non-profit research. I aim to obtain a license permitting unlimited free use for legitimate academic and non-profit research by February 2020. 

Until I obtain this license, I require that all Hemlock users obtain written permission from its copyright holder, Dillon Bowen. Any use without written permission from the copyright holder is strictly prohibited.

## In Progress

Documentation in progress.
