Smoother is a statistical tool for computing non-parametric distributions by optimizing a constrained smoothing function.

We often want to estimate a distribution given limited information, such as its mean and standard deviation. Rather than impose parametric assumptions, smoother uses non-parametric techniques to infer an entire distribution given limited information.
